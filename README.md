# Code Examples from Cody Beardsley
To whomever reads this, this README is coupled with three examples of my coding style in three different languages. Find below additional context for each to hopefully make sense of what they were once a part of.

## Python
This is an endpoint class from an enterprise-level real estate marketing platform written in Python/Django. The purpose of this endpoint is to manage an internal Do Not Call (DNC) registry that a ReactJS frontend uploads CSVs to and polls its state from.

## Angular
This is an abstraction class used to invoke the native camera prompt in a hybrid mobile application written in Ionic with Angular. It comes from an internal application used by an agricultural inspection agency for third-part auditing of produce as it transits from farm to cold-storage.

## Terraform/Ansible
This is an honestly more trivial and rough than ideal example, but I thought it good to include it simply to demonstrate foundation using infrastructure as code. This particular example is for deploying a one-off production Postgres database replica that uses attached storage to upgrade storage capacity and modularity within Linode, the hosting provider.
